This is a helm chart that deploys a [Krakend](https://www.krakend.io/) instance.

## Description

A Helm chart for deploying krakend.io in Kubernetes provided
and maintained by your friends at Equinix Metal

## Installation

* Add the Equinix Metal helm repository
```bash
helm repo add equinixmetal https://helm.equinixmetal.com
```

* Install the helm chart using default values
```bash
helm install krakend equinixmetal/krakend
```

> If you are using your own chart, reference the following to your chart's dependencies:
> ```yaml
> dependencies:
>   - name: krakend
>     version: v0.1.16
>     repository: "https://helm.equinixmetal.com"
> ```

## Usage

There are two main modes of operation:

* configMap-based: the configuration is stored in a configMaps and mounted in the
  container.

* all-in-one image: the configuration is stored in the container image itself.

Note that the all-in-one image method assumes that the configuration is stored
in the `/etc/krakend-src/config` path. This is done to allow for mounting
the license as describe in the section below.

Both modes of operation enable the flexible configuration feature. For the all-in-one
image, this is done so that the configuration can take environment variables into use.

Note that for a further description on how to use partials, settings and templates,
please refer to [the official krakend documentation](https://www.krakend.io/docs/configuration/flexible-config/).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)

### Testing

Ensure that the documentation is up to date before pushing a pull request:

```bash
helm-docs
```

### Releasing

There is a useful Makefile target that's useful to cut a release. So, simply do:

```bash
TAG=$RELEASE_VERSION make release
```

And the release will happen.

Note that this project follows the [Semantic Versioning scheme](https://semver.org/), so
make sure to follow it when cutting releases.

The `TAG` Makefile variable takes a release version without the `v` prefix. For example,
if you want to cut a release with version `v1.2.3`, you'd do:

```bash
TAG=1.2.3 make release
```

# Using Krakend.io Enterprise

Krakend.io Enterprise is a commercial product that extends the capabilities
of the open source Krakend.io API Gateway. It is available as a Docker image
that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the open source image.

In order to configure the helm chart to use it, you'd need a values file similar
as the following:

```yaml
image:
  registry: docker.io
  repository: krakend/krakend-ee
  tag: "2.1.2"
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: license
    mountPath: /etc/krakend/LICENSE
    readOnly: true
extraVolumes:
  - name: license
    secret:
      secretName: krakend-license
```

Note the mount of the license file in the `/etc/krakend/LICENSE` path.
